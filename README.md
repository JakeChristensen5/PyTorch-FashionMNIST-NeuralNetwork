# PyTorch-FashionMNIST-NeuralNetwork
PyTorch FashionMNIST Neural Network
This project implements a basic neural network using PyTorch for classifying images from the FashionMNIST dataset. It includes code for setting up the Python Virtual Environment, building the neural network model, training the model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions on test data.

# Assignment Goals
Set up PyTorch environment and familiarize with tools
Implement and train a basic neural network using PyTorch
Explore deep learning concepts in practice
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

# Clone the repository to your local machine.
Set up the Python Virtual Environment using the provided instructions in the assignment.
Run the intro_pytorch.py script to execute the neural network implementation.
Follow the instructions in the script to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.

Implementation Details
Setting up Virtual Environment: The project utilizes Python Virtual Environment for package management, ensuring project-specific dependencies are maintained.
Building the Neural Network: The neural network model is constructed using PyTorch's Sequential container, consisting of layers for flattening, dense connections, and activation functions.
Training the Model: The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with cross-entropy loss as the criterion. Training progress is displayed after each epoch.
Evaluating Performance: The trained model's performance is evaluated on the test set, displaying accuracy and loss metrics.
Making Predictions: Predictions are made on individual test images, displaying the top three most likely class labels along with their probabilities.
